# KPMG Data Analytics Internship

In this project I used K-Means clustering, RFM Metrics and Cohort Analysis for customer segmentation to find loyal customers for a Bicycle Company
In this internship I was tasked with 3 tasks:
- Data Assessment
- Data Modeling
- Data Insights

## Data Assessment
Data assessment was done according to common industry metrics
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Currency
- Relevancy
- Validity
- Uniqueness

## Data Modeling 
For data Modeling I used K-means Clustering (the elbow method was used to find the number of clusters) in order to find
common characteristics of different segments and find loyal customers

## Data Insights
Later we were tasked to build a Tableau dashboard to present to the client.
